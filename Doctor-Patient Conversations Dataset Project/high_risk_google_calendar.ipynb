We encountered several difficulties during physical therapy on the acute ward. First, any change of position or deep breathing triggered coughing attacks that induced oxygen desaturation and dyspnea. To avoid rapid deterioration and respiratory failure, we instructed and performed position changes very slowly and step-by-step. In this way, a position change to the 135° prone position () took around 30 minutes. This approach was well tolerated and increased oxygen saturation, for example, on day 5 with 6 L/min of oxygen from 93% to 97%. Second, we had to adapt the breathing exercises to avoid prolonged coughing and oxygen desaturation. Accordingly, we instructed the patient to stop every deep breath before the need to cough and to hold inspiration for better air distribution. In this manner, the patient performed the breathing exercises well and managed to increase his oxygen saturation. Third, the patient had difficulty maintaining sufficient oxygen saturation during physical activity. However, with close monitoring and frequent breaks, he managed to perform strength and walking exercises at a low level without any significant deoxygenation. Exercise progression was low on days 1 to 5, but then increased daily until hospital discharge to a rehabilitation clinic on day 10.\\n    Conversation: Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?\\nPatient: I'm feeling a bit better, thank you.\\nDoctor: I see from your clinical notes that you were hospitalized due to moderate ARDS from COVID-19.

The patient initially needed 4 L/min of oxygen, had a rapid and shallow breathing pattern at rest and became severely breathless during minor physical activities. In the beginning, physical therapy focused on patient education about dyspnea-relieving positions, the importance of regular mobilization, and deep-breathing exercises. However, it quickly became evident that his anxiety from fear of dying and worries about his future aggravated his dyspnea and vice versa. The patient was so dyspneic, anxious, and weak that he was barely able to walk to the toilet. To counter this vicious circle, the physical therapist actively listened to the patient, explained why he was experiencing breathlessness, and tested suitable positions to relieve his dyspnea. He seemed to benefit from the education and the relaxing breathing exercises, as seen on day 2, when his respiratory rate could be reduced from 30 breaths/min to 22 breaths/min and his oxygen saturation increased from 92% to 96% on 4 L/min oxygen after guiding him through some deep-breathing exercises. Over the next days, his dyspnea and anxiety started to alleviate and he regained his self-confidence. Therapy was progressively shifted to walking and strength training and the patient rapidly advanced to walk 350 m without a walking aid or supplemental oxygen before his discharge home.\\n    Conversation: Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?\\nPatient: Not so great, I've been hospitalized for a while now.\\nDoctor: I see. Can you tell me about your general health condition?\\nPatient: I've been experiencing persistent fever and dry cough for the past two weeks.\\nDoctor: Okay. And have you been needing oxygen?\\nPatient: Yes, I initially needed 4 L/min of oxygen.\\nDoctor: I see. And how has your breathing been, particularly when you're at rest?\\nPatient: My breathing has been rapid and shallow at rest and severely breathless during minor physical activities.\\nDoctor: I understand. Have you been receiving physical therapy?\\nPatient: Yes, physical therapy has been focusing on educating me about dyspnea-relieving positions and the importance of regular mobilization and deep-breathing exercises.\\nDoctor: That's great to hear. Has it been helpful?\\nPatient: It has, but my anxiety and fear of dying have been aggravating my dyspnea and vice versa.\\nDoctor: I see. That's understandable.

Initially the patient received lung-protective ventilation and targeted sedation, but was otherwise stable. Treatment interventions included passive range of motion and positioning including passive mobilization into a side-edge position (). Over the next days, the patient deteriorated with hemodynamic instability and severe ARDS leading to intermittent prone positioning and continuous renal replacement therapy. The role of physical therapists during proning was to ensure correct joint positioning and pressure prophylaxis to prevent secondary complications such as nerve lesions, contractures, or pressure ulcers. Nevertheless, the long duration and repeated positioning resulted in a small pressure ulcer on the patient’s forehead. After tracheostomy, passive range-of-motion exercises, and passive side-edge mobilization were slowly resumed, whereby asynchronous ventilation and hemodynamic instability remained 2 major problems leading to further sedation and relaxation, thus inhibiting any active participation. After 24 days in the ICU, the patient scored 1/50 points on the Chelsea Critical Care Physical Assessment Tool (CPAx) and showed severe signs of muscle loss. The patient died soon after withdrawal of life support.\\n    Conversation: Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?\\nPatient: Not very good, doctor. I've been really sick.\\nDoctor: I see. When were you admitted to the hospital?\\nPatient: I was admitted about a month ago.\\nDoctor: And what brought you in?\\nPatient: I had a dry cough for 2 weeks and my oxygen levels were really low.\\nDoctor: Ah, I see.

One day later, he was hospitalized with exertional dyspnea. He was diagnosed with pneumonia that developed into moderate ARDS needing mechanical ventilation and intermittent dialysis. After extubation, oxygenation was stable with 2 to 3 L/min of oxygen. However, the patient was disoriented and could not communicate verbally. His global weakness (CPAx 11/50) was accompanied by oral and pharyngeal weakness and paresthesia. Spontaneous swallowing frequency and tongue control were severely reduced, and the patient showed insufficient protection from aspiration. This was confirmed by a specialized physical therapist with the Gugging Swallowing Screen, which confirmed severe dysphagia with 2/20 points. He was treated nil by mouth and received dysphagia therapy such as intensive oral stimulation, facilitation of swallowing, and training of protection mechanisms. After initial agitation and disorientation, the patient started to communicate in single-word phrases, but dysphagia continued to be severe with massive oral and pharyngeal dry saliva residuals that compromised his paresthesia and required regular mouth care. Over the next days, the patient managed to swallow pureéd food and mildly thick fluids under supervision, although cough strength was still weak (Gugging Swallowing Screen 13/20, CPAx 30/50). Nevertheless, he continued to progress and became capable of independent food ingestion (Gugging Swallowing Screen 20/20, CPAx 39/50) before his discharge to a rehabilitation clinic 25 days after admission.\\n    Conversation: Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?\\nPatient: Not great, I've been feeling really sick lately.\\nDoctor: I see from your medical records that you tested COVID-19 positive.

Moderate ARDS with reduced lung compliance was diagnosed and treated with deep sedation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and prone positioning.\\nOn day 14, a trial of sitting on the edge-of-bed (SOEB) was performed, while she was still intubated and under pressure support ventilation. SOEB required 3 physical therapists to maintain the position, but resulted in a significant increase in her level of consciousness and collaborative state. The next day, she was able to hold her head and sit for about 15 minutes with 2 therapists. Her muscle strength indicated ICU-acquired weakness, with a Medical Research Council sum-score (MRC-SS) of 40/60; still she continued with small but consistent improvements and started to participate actively in physical therapy sessions. She was encouraged to mobilize herself with exercises against gravity and was actively transferred to a chair each day with the help of 2 physical therapists. She was successfully extubated, but presented postextubation dysphagia. The physical therapy team closely monitored her for secretion management and cough stimulation and continued her physical rehabilitation. On day 19, she started to walk with a walking aid, although at this point oxygen desaturation during exercise training became evident (89% with 3 L/min of oxygen). After 25 days, she was transferred to the institution’s rehabilitation facilities, where a battery of tests indicated persistent physical function impairment (MRC-SS 52/60, physical function ICU test score17 9/12, Timed Up & Go 23 seconds, short physical performance battery 4/12).\\n    Conversation: Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?\\nPatient: Hmm, not too well.

This required 3 physical therapists to maintain your position, but resulted in a significant increase in your level of consciousness and collaborative state.\\nPatient: Yes, I remember that.\\nDoctor: The next day, you were able to sit for about 15 minutes with the help of 2 therapists. Your muscle strength indicated ICU-acquired weakness, with a Medical Research Council sum-score of 40/60. However, you continued to make small but consistent improvements and started actively participating in physical therapy sessions.\\nPatient: Okay.\\nDoctor: You were encouraged to mobilize yourself with exercises against gravity and were actively transferred to a chair each day with the help of 2 physical therapists. You were successfully extubated, but presented postextubation dysphagia.\\nPatient: Yes, I remember that too.\\nDoctor: The physical therapy team closely monitored you for secretion management and cough stimulation and continued your physical rehabilitation. On day 19, you started to walk with a walking aid, although at this point oxygen desaturation during exercise training became evident. Your oxygen saturation level dropped to 89% with 3 L/min of oxygen.\\nPatient: Oh no.\\nDoctor: After 25 days, you were transferred to the institution’s rehabilitation facilities, where a battery of tests indicated persistent physical function impairment with a MRC-SS of 52/60, physical function ICU test score of 9/12, Timed Up & Go of 23 seconds, and short physical performance battery of 4/12.\\nPatient: What does that mean?\\nDoctor: It means that there is still some physical function impairment and we need to continue your physical rehabilitation.

She was intubated and proned due to rapid respiratory deterioration. For the following 6 days, her situation was unstable, and physical therapy consisted of prone positioning and prevention of secondary damage. From day 7 onwards, she started to improve rapidly and could be mobilized passively into a side-edge position. After extubation, she presented postextubation dysphagia and severe ICU-acquired weakness (MRC-SS 36/60). She also suffered from pronounced delirium and anxiety and said repeatedly that she had been abducted and that she believed she had to die. She seemed to feel threatened by us and it was difficult to calm her down. Due to the pandemic measures of the Swiss government, hospital visits were not generally allowed, but because her anxiety was limiting her rehabilitation, her husband was granted an exceptional permission to visit her. This seemed to give the patient a short sense of security, and she started to participate in some basic functional activities (CPAx 21/50). Nevertheless, the delirium did not resolve upon her transfer to a peripheral acute hospital.\\n    Conversation: Doctor: Hi there, how are you feeling today?\\nPatient: Not very good, I've been feeling sick for about a week now.\\nDoctor: Can you tell me what kind of symptoms you've been experiencing?\\nPatient: I've had a high fever, dry cough, headache, and difficulty breathing.\\nDoctor: Those are typical COVID-19 symptoms. It's good that you came in for admission.\\nPatient: Yes, they had to intubate me and put me in a prone position because my breathing was getting worse.\\nDoctor: I see. You were also receiving physical therapy to prevent any secondary damage.\\nPatient: Yes, but my situation was unstable for the first 6 days.\\nDoctor: That's understandable. But after day 7, you started to improve rapidly and could be mobilized into a side-edge position.\\nPatient: Yes, but after they extubated me, I had trouble swallowing and my muscles were very weak.\\nDoctor: That's called postextubation dysphagia and severe ICU-acquired weakness. Did you also suffer from delirium and anxiety?\\nPatient: Yes, I kept thinking I was abducted and that I had to die. It was difficult for the hospital staff to calm me down.\\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Due to the pandemic measures, hospital visits weren't allowed, but your husband was granted permission to visit you because your anxiety was limiting your rehabilitation.\\nPatient: Yes, that helped a little bit and I was able to participate in some basic functional activities.\\nDoctor: That's good to hear.

He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 the following day but continued to deteriorate resulting in severe ARDS, intubation, and ICU admission. Despite repeated proning, gas exchange did not improve sufficiently and the patient was placed on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 7 days. After sedation was stopped, the patient continued to be somnolent and unable to communicate or to follow commands. Physical therapy therefore focused on perception training, movement exercises, airway-clearing techniques, dysphagia therapy, and mobilization. A first SOEB trial had to be discontinued due to hemodynamic instability. Instead, the patient was positioned in a side-edge position (), which he tolerated better and where an intensive exercise training including trunk and head control was conducted. Nevertheless, muscle tone and strength remained severely reduced, particularly on his hemiplegic side, and a second SOEB trial failed again. Physical therapy was also limited because of reduced self-activity and suspected impaired perception and visual acuity. Consequently, occupational therapy was involved to create a basis of communication, to support functional initiation of upper limb movements, and to integrate perception-training into activities of daily living. Currently, the patient tolerates spontaneous breathing trials, shows signs of being alert during therapy, but cannot communicate. He is hemodynamically stable, even in an SOEB position, but remains functionally dependent (CPAx 6/50).\\n    Conversation: Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?\\nPatient: Hmm, not so good. \\nDoctor: I can see from your medical records that you were admitted to the hospital due to an ischemic left-hemispheric stroke, dry cough, and fever.

We had to place you on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 7 days to help with your gas exchange. \\nPatient: Okay, I vaguely remember that. \\nDoctor: After sedation was stopped, you continued to be somnolent and unable to communicate or follow commands. \\nPatient: Yes, I remember feeling very drowsy. \\nDoctor: That's understandable.
